   <h3>Step 3</h3>
   <p>Sauté the chopped onions in the hot oil until soft, stir in the rinsed rice and toast for about a minute or two making sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.
     Pour the chicken stock over the rice, the reserved seasoning and stir to combine.
     Deglaze the bottom of the pan while stirring by scraping the bottom of the pan. This way the rice doesn’t burn when cooking.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Arrange the chicken thighs over the rice then cover the pot with its lid and cook on low-medium heat for about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the type of rice you are using. 
  When the rice is done, it would be tender, fluffy and the water would be absorbed too</p>
